# N-Queen Game with Hill Climbing Algorithm

## Overview

This Java project implements the N-Queen problem using the Hill Climbing algorithm. The N-Queen problem is a classic computer science problem in which the objective is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. The Hill Climbing algorithm is a heuristic search method used for mathematical optimization problems, which continuously moves towards increasing value (for maximization) or decreasing value (for minimization) to find a solution.

## Features

- **Configurable Board Size**: Choose the size of the chessboard (N) you want to solve for.
- **Hill Climbing Algorithm**: Efficiently finds solutions to the N-Queen problem.
- **Textual Representation**: Displays the solution as a text-based chessboard.
- **Simple Command Line Interface**: Easy to use interface to set parameters and start the solution process.

## Usage

To run this project, ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
